# Doom Engine
# About
This is a attempt of making a doom engine

I am using `Love2D` to code
### Why?
Lua is one of my favorites languages, for many reasons and is the language
 I fell more confortable for making games

## State of the project
I don't know how long I will be making this, but I hope I can make the full
 engine

I want this engine to be "re-writable" using other languages and frameworks,
 that's why I have some warnings in the `main.lua` file

# Running
Install `Love2D` and run on the root directory
